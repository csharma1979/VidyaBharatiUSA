            Many Vidya Bharati schools in rural and tribal areas lack proper
            toilet facilities, creating health risks and barriers to
            educationâ€”especially for girl students. Your contribution to
            construct toilet blocks will create safe, hygienic environments that
            promote dignity, health, and education.
          </p>

          <p className="alumni-desc">
            Each toilet block provides separate facilities for boys and girls,
            with proper drainage systems and handwashing stations. These
            facilities are essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing
            disease spread in school communities.
